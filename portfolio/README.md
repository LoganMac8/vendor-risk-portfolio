# Vendor Risk & GRC Portfolio

Welcome to my Vendor Risk and Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) portfolio.  
This collection showcases the core skills, documentation standards, and analytical thinking I’ve developed while studying and practicing third-party risk management, security governance, and SOC 2–aligned controls.

My goal with this portfolio is simple: demonstrate that I can think like a GRC analyst, document like an auditor, and assess vendors with a structured, risk-based mindset. Every file in this folder reflects real industry workflows—intake → assessment → evidence review → analysis → reporting.
