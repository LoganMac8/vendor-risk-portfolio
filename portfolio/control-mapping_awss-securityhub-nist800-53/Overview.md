# Overview

This project provides a structured, multi-framework control mapping that aligns
several major security and compliance standards used across the industry,
including:

- NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5  
- SOC 2 (Trust Services Criteria)  
- ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A  

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a clear, repeatable process for
harmonizing controls across frameworks, identifying coverage gaps, and creating
a unified view of security maturity. This type of crosswalk is commonly used
in GRC, Vendor Risk Management, Audit Readiness, and Cloud Security programs.

## Purpose of This Project

Organizations frequently operate under multiple regulatory, contractual, or
industry obligations. Aligning these frameworks reduces redundant efforts and
creates a more scalable compliance program. This mapping project helps:

- Centralize control objectives  
- Streamline evidence collection  
- Identify overlapping expectations  
- Reduce audit fatigue  
- Improve cross-framework reporting  
- Support risk-based decision making  

## What's Included

This project includes:

- A detailed mapping of NIST → SOC 2  
- A detailed mapping of SOC 2 → ISO 27001  
- A detailed mapping of NIST → ISO 27001  
- Identified gaps where controls do not map cleanly  
- Recommendations to close those gaps  
- A concise summary for leadership or auditors  

## Intended Audience

This repository is designed for:

- GRC Analysts  
- Compliance and Audit teams  
- Vendor Risk Assessors  
- Security Engineers  
- Cloud and IT Governance professionals  
- Hiring managers seeking to evaluate my technical depth  

## How This Project Demonstrates My Skillset

This project reflects hands-on experience with:

- Framework interpretation  
- Control alignment and normalization  
- Governance documentation  
- Evidence-based compliance analysis  
- Technical writing with precision and clarity  
- Risk-based decision making  

This is a practical, industry-aligned demonstration of how I approach GRC work
in a structured, scalable, and audit-ready way.
