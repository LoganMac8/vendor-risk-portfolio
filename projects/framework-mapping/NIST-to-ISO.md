# NIST 800-53 Rev 5 → ISO 27001:2022 Control Mapping  
This document compares key NIST 800-53 security and privacy controls with ISO 27001:2022 Annex A controls.  
The goal is to show framework literacy, mapping logic, and the ability to translate between regulatory requirements.

---

## 📌 How to Read This Mapping  
Each entry includes:

- **NIST Control Family & ID** — e.g., AC-2 (Access Control)  
- **ISO 27001 Annex A Match** — corresponding ISO control(s)  
- **Match Type** — Direct / Partial / Conceptual  
- **Notes** — what an auditor or assessor should understand about the alignment  

This is a *representative, high-value*, recruiter-friendly mapping — not an exhaustive catalog.
