## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated  
This project highlights the ability to:

- Interpret and align multiple compliance frameworks  
- Perform structured gap analysis across security controls  
- Translate technical requirements into clear documentation  
- Produce governance-ready artifacts that withstand auditor scrutiny  
- Apply risk-based thinking when evaluating controls  
- Communicate complex concepts in a clear, organized, and professional manner

## ⭐ Why This Project Matters  
Modern organizations rarely rely on a single framework.  
GRC and Vendor Risk Analysts must be able to:

- Reconcile overlapping requirements  
- Identify where a vendor or internal security program is non-compliant  
- Recommend improvements supported by evidence and best practices  
- Create documentation that auditors and stakeholders can immediately understand  

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

- **Framework alignment**  
- **Security control analysis**  
- **Audit readiness**  
- **Technical security writing**  
- **Risk and compliance evaluation**  

It reflects the exact type of work performed in **GRC, Vendor Risk Management, Security Assurance, Compliance Operations,** and **Third-Party Risk** roles.

## 🏁 Final Note  
This isn’t a theoretical exercise—it's modeled after real-world assessments used in enterprise security programs.  
It shows attention to detail, strong analytical capability, and the ability to produce polished, professional GRC artifacts.
