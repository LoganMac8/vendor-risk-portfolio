## ⭐ Why This Project Matters
Compliance professionals must be able to reconcile different security frameworks, translate requirements, and identify where controls overlap—or don’t.

This project proves:
- I understand multiple frameworks  
- I can map controls accurately  
- I can explain security requirements clearly  
- I can build audit-ready documentation  

This is the type of work performed in Vendor Risk, GRC, Compliance, and Security Assurance roles.
