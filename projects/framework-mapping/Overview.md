# Framework Mapping Overview  
This document introduces the purpose, scope, and structure of the Framework Mapping Project.  
It explains why mapping NIST 800-53, SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria, and ISO 27001 is essential for modern security, compliance, and vendor risk teams.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Project
Organizations often operate under multiple frameworks simultaneously—NIST, SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.  
Each framework uses different terminology, control structures, and requirements.

This project was created to:

- Provide a clear, readable mapping between major compliance frameworks  
- Help identify where controls overlap, differ, or contain gaps  
- Support governance teams in consolidating requirements  
- Improve audit readiness and reduce duplicated effort  
- Demonstrate real-world GRC and vendor risk analysis skills

## 🔍 Frameworks Included in This Mapping
### **NIST 800-53 (Rev. 5)**
A highly granular control framework widely used in federal and regulated environments.  
Focuses on security controls across 20 families (AC, AU, CM, etc.).

### **SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria**
A framework used for service organizations to prove security, availability, confidentiality, processing integrity, and privacy.

### **ISO/IEC 27001:2022**
A globally recognized Information Security Management System (ISMS) standard focused on organizational governance and risk reduction.

## 🎯 Objective of the Mapping
The goal is to create a readable and accurate crosswalk that shows:

- **Where controls align (1-to-1 or many-to-one)**  
- **Where controls partially overlap**  
- **Where controls exist in one framework but not the others (gaps)**  
- **Where compensating controls may apply**

This provides actionable insight for:

- Audit preparation  
- Vendor security evaluations  
- Control implementation planning  
- Policy alignment  
- Risk treatment decisions

## 📁 What’s Included in This Folder
This folder contains seven curated documents:

- `Methodology.md` — How the mapping and analysis were performed  
- `NIST-to-SOC2.md` — Detailed alignment table  
- `SOC2-to-ISO.md` — Detailed alignment table  
- `NIST-to-ISO.md` — Detailed alignment table  
- `Gaps-and-Recommendations.md` — Identified gaps + treatment options  
- `Summary.md` — Executive-level summary

## 🧩 Why This Work Matters
Security and compliance teams must navigate constantly changing standards.  
Being able to map frameworks is a top skill in:

- GRC  
- Vendor Risk  
- Cybersecurity Compliance  
- Audit & Assurance  
- Policy Governance  
- Third-Party Risk Management  

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

- Requirements analysis  
- Control interpretation  
- Technical documentation  
- GRC methodologies  
- Risk-based reasoning  
- Communicating complex data clearly
