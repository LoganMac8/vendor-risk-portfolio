# Framework Mapping Summary  
This document provides a high-level summary of the crosswalk between NIST 800-53, SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria, and ISO 27001:2022. It highlights control alignment, gaps discovered, and the overall maturity insights gained from the mapping exercise.

# 🌐 Project Overview  
The purpose of this framework mapping project is to demonstrate the ability to:  
- Interpret multiple industry security frameworks  
- Identify equivalencies and misalignments across controls  
- Evaluate the maturity of an organization’s security posture  
- Recommend improvements to achieve multi-framework compliance  
- Produce clear, audit-ready documentation  

This aligns directly with real Vendor Risk, GRC, and Compliance Analyst responsibilities.

# 🔄 Control Alignment Summary  
Across all three frameworks, several universal themes emerged:

### **Common Areas of Strong Alignment**
- Access control & least privilege  
- Encryption of data in transit and at rest  
- Logging, monitoring, and auditability  
- Secure development practices  
- Vendor and subprocessor management  
- Incident response planning  
- Business continuity expectations  

These control families map consistently, making them strong areas of overlap.

# ⚠️ Key Differences Noted
Some frameworks are more prescriptive than others:

### **NIST 800-53**
- Most detailed and technical  
- Requires explicit documentation and evidence trails  
- Includes rigorous requirements for baseline configuration, rollback plans, and periodic testing  

### **ISO 27001**
- Balanced and process-driven  
- Strong emphasis on supplier lifecycle and governance  
- Allows flexibility as long as controls are documented and justified  

### **SOC 2**
- Principles-based  
- Less prescriptive, more outcome-focused  
- Depends on service auditor interpretation  

Because of these differences, organizations may meet SOC 2 but fall short of ISO or NIST without additional rigor.

---

# 🧩 Gap Insights  
Several gaps were identified when aligning all three frameworks:

- Limited rollback documentation in change management  
- Inconsistent access review scheduling  
- Lack of detailed data lifecycle documentation  
- Cloud configuration checks not always automated  
- Incident response exercises not performed annually  

Each gap includes a clear remediation path in the accompanying `Gaps-and-Recommendations.md` file.

---

# 📈 Maturity Observation  
A security program aligned to NIST-level rigor generally satisfies SOC 2 and ISO requirements as well.  
The strongest programs:

- Maintain detailed documentation  
- Test controls regularly  
- Automate evidence collection  
- Apply governance consistently across teams  
- Treat compliance as an active, ongoing process  

This mapping exercise demonstrates those same principles.

# 🏁 Final Statement  
This Framework Mapping Project showcases the ability to operate like a real GRC/Risk Analyst by:

- Performing multi-framework analysis  
- Identifying overlaps, gaps, and risks  
- Packaging technical content into clean, audit-ready artifacts  
- Demonstrating precision, organization, and practical security understanding  

It is an excellent addition to a recruiting portfolio, highlighting both technical knowledge and professional documentation skills.
