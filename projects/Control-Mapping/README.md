# 🔐 Control Mapping Project  
### NIST CSF 2.0 → SOC 2 → ISO 27001:2022  
A Cross-Framework Alignment & Gap Analysis Project

This project demonstrates my ability to interpret, compare, and harmonize modern cybersecurity frameworks — a core skill in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC). It includes detailed control mappings across **NIST CSF 2.0**, **SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria**, and **ISO 27001:2022 Annex A controls**, along with a formal gap analysis and actionable recommendations.

The goal of this project is to show how different frameworks overlap, where they diverge, and how organizations can build a unified control set that supports audits, assessments, and continuous compliance efforts.

## 📁 Contents

### **1. Overview**
High-level explanation of the project purpose, scope, and objectives.

### **2. Methodology**
How I approached control interpretation, equivalency scoring, mapping logic, and gap validation.

### **3. Framework Mappings**
Located in `/Mappings/`

- **NIST CSF 2.0 → SOC 2**
- **SOC 2 → ISO 27001:2022**
- **NIST CSF 2.0 → ISO 27001:2022**

Each mapping includes:
- Side-by-side control tables  
- Match types: *Direct Match*, *Partial Match*, *No Match*  
- Alignment notes  
- Context for implementation  

### **4. Gaps & Recommendations**
Analysis of gaps between frameworks and risk-based recommendations for strengthening a unified control environment.

### **5. Summary**
Key findings, takeaways, and how this work can support Vendor Risk, Audit readiness, and Security Program Maturity.

## 👤 About This Project

This project was created as part of my growing work in Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC). It reflects real-world deliverables produced by GRC analysts in roles such as:

- Security Analyst (GRC)  
- Risk Analyst  
- Vendor Risk Analyst  
- Compliance Analyst  
- Audit & Controls Specialist  

My goal is to develop hands-on, practical skills that translate directly to supporting audits, security assessments, and enterprise risk programs.
