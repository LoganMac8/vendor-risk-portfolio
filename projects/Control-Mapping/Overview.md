# 📘 Control Mapping Project — Overview  
### NIST CSF 2.0 → SOC 2 → ISO 27001:2022

This document provides a clear, high-level overview of the Control Mapping Project. It explains the purpose, scope, assumptions, and deliverables in a way that mirrors real GRC workflow documentation used in risk, audit, and compliance programs.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to analyze and harmonize three major cybersecurity frameworks:

- **NIST CSF 2.0 (2024 update)**
- **SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria**
- **ISO 27001:2022 Annex A Controls**

Organizations often follow multiple frameworks simultaneously, and this project shows how they align, overlap, or diverge.  
The outcome is a unified control map that reduces audit complexity, improves consistency, and supports strong governance.

---

## 📌 Scope

This project includes:

- Reviewing all functional categories of **NIST CSF 2.0**
- Mapping NIST CSF functions → SOC 2 criteria → ISO 27001 controls
- Documenting where controls align, partially align, or do not align
- Performing a high-level **gap analysis**
- Recommending action items to strengthen compliance

Not included in scope:

- A full implementation guide  
- Detailed policy writing  
- Evidence collection or internal audit execution  
- Deep technical control validation (penetration testing, etc.)

This scope reflects what a junior–mid GRC analyst would realistically complete during an internal project or assessment cycle.

## 🧩 Why This Project Matters

Security teams rarely follow just one framework. Most organizations must satisfy:

- Regulatory requirements  
- Customer questionnaires  
- Audit expectations  
- Contractual obligations  
- Internal governance standards  

Control mapping enables:

- Consolidated compliance  
- Reduced operational effort  
- Easier audit readiness  
- Stronger vendor risk management  
- Better communication with stakeholders  

This is one of the highest-value skills in GRC.

## 🔍 Methodology Summary

The mapping process followed a structured approach:

1. **Reviewed authoritative sources**  
   - NIST CSF 2.0 documentation  
   - SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria  
   - ISO 27001:2022 Annex A  
   - Crosswalks from reputable security organizations  

2. **Established equivalency categories**
   - **Direct Match**  
   - **Partial Match**  
   - **No Match**  
   - **Context Match** (controls align in intent)

3. **Mapped controls across all three frameworks**  
   - Based on function, intent, scope, and expected outcomes

4. **Documented alignment notes**  
   - Clarifying rationale behind each mapping decision

5. **Performed gap analysis**  
   - Identifying missing or weaker areas across frameworks
