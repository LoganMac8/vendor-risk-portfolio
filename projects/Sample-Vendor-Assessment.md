Sample Vendor Assessment

Fictional Vendor Nimbus Analytics
Assessment Type Initial Security Review

This document represents a full vendor security assessment based on SOC Two evidence, ISO controls, a security questionnaire, and the standard Vendor Risk Scoring Model.

Section One Vendor Overview

Vendor Name Nimbus Analytics
Service Provided Cloud based analytics platform used for reporting and data visualization
Data Shared Internal business data and limited customer usage metrics
Integration Type API based

The purpose of this assessment is to determine whether Nimbus Analytics can be approved as a vendor and whether any remediation is required before onboarding.

Section Two Evidence Reviewed

The following evidence was reviewed for this assessment

SOC Two Type Two report covering Security and Availability
Vendor Security Questionnaire with twenty five responses
ISO Twenty Seven Thousand One Certificate of Conformity
Penetration test summary conducted within the last twelve months
Backup and recovery documentation
Incident response plan

Section Three SOC Two Review Summary

Scope includes the analytics platform, customer data processing pipeline, logging services, and administrative portal.

Included Trust Service Criteria
Security
Availability

Key strengths identified
Access control processes are mature
Multi factor authentication enforced for administrative access
Logging and monitoring reviewed daily
Backups tested quarterly
Change management process well documented

Exceptions found
One access review was completed later than the required timeframe
Auditor notes indicate this issue was isolated and remediated

Conclusion
Controls are generally mature and effective. The exception does not materially reduce the vendor’s security posture.

Section Four ISO Vendor Related Controls Review

Relevant controls from A point Five, A point Six, A point Eight, A point Ten, and A point Fifteen were evaluated.

Strengths
Security policies are reviewed annually
All personnel complete security awareness training
Vulnerability management program includes monthly scanning
Encryption is applied to all sensitive data
Supplier lifecycle processes exist and are documented

Gaps identified
Change management documentation exists but does not include rollback procedures
This increases operational risk slightly but does not indicate control failure

Section Five Questionnaire Review Summary

The vendor responded accurately and consistently.
Important positive indicators

Encryption is used for both storage and transmission
Backups tested quarterly
Incident response plan reviewed annually
Applications tested before release
Penetration tests performed every twelve months

Items requiring clarification

Vendor does not currently support customer owned encryption keys
Low impact for this use case
Vendor does not provide customer specific audit logs
An acceptable limitation due to shared service architecture

Section Six Risk Scoring Model Application

Impact Rating
Rated as Four
The vendor processes internal data and contributes to reporting functions. An outage would create operational delays but not severe financial or regulatory harm.

Likelihood Rating
Rated as Three
The vendor has mature controls but contains minor issues such as a delayed access review and incomplete rollback planning.

Final Risk Rating
High Risk

High Risk vendors require a remediation plan but can be approved if risks are addressed.

Section Seven Required Remediation

Two remediation items are required before onboarding

One
Vendor must document rollback procedures in the change management process

Two
Vendor must provide confirmation that the access review process has been updated to prevent delayed reviews

Expected remediation timeframe
Thirty days

Section Eight Final Recommendation

Nimbus Analytics is suitable for conditional approval.
The vendor demonstrates strong technical and administrative controls, supported by a SOC Two Type Two report and ISO certification.
Risk is elevated due to minor operational gaps but can be fully addressed through remediation.

Final decision
Conditional Approval

Onboarding may proceed once remediation evidence is provided.

Summary

This assessment demonstrates the complete Vendor Risk workflow
evidence review
SOC Two analysis
ISO control evaluation
questionnaire validation
risk scoring
remediation
and a final approval decision

This is the same structured process used in real Vendor Risk programs.
