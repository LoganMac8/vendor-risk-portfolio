# Vendor Risk Scoring Model  
A complete, audit-ready quantitative scoring framework used to classify third-party vendors based on likelihood, impact, and control strength. This model mirrors the scoring logic used in mature TPRM, GRC, and Security Assurance programs.

## 📌 Purpose  
This project demonstrates the ability to:  
- Build a structured, defensible vendor scoring methodology  
- Quantify risk using measurable inputs  
- Align scoring with SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, and FFIEC expectations  
- Communicate results clearly across Procurement, Legal, and Security  
- Produce documentation suitable for audits, regulators, and leadership reviews  

It proves proficiency in risk modeling, control assessment, and third-party due diligence.

## ⭐ Why Recruiters Care  
This project showcases real-world GRC and TPRM capabilities that hiring managers look for:

- Ability to quantify vendor risk  
- Ability to build structured compliance documentation  
- Ability to translate controls into scoring criteria  
- Ability to model risk the same way enterprise GRC teams do  

This is the kind of work Vendor Risk Analysts, GRC Analysts, and Security Assurance Specialists perform daily.
