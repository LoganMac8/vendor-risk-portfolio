# Vendor Risk Scoring Model  
A quantitative, repeatable scoring framework used to evaluate third-party vendors based on likelihood × impact analysis.

## 📌 Purpose  
This model provides an objective way to classify vendors into risk tiers by analyzing their control strength, exposure level, data sensitivity, and business criticality. It is designed to support Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) programs with consistent, defensible scoring results.

## ⭐ Why This Project Matters  
A scoring model is one of the core tools used by Vendor Risk, Security Assurance, and GRC teams.  
This project demonstrates the ability to:

- Build standardized risk scoring frameworks  
- Translate vendor evidence into numerical scoring  
- Communicate risk levels to stakeholders  
- Support audit-ready, repeatable TPRM processes
