# Vendor Risk Scoring Model – Overview  
A structured, quantitative model designed to evaluate third-party vendors using likelihood × impact scoring. The goal is to standardize vendor classification, support defensible TPRM decisions, and ensure consistency across all vendor assessments.

## 📌 What This Model Does  
This scoring model evaluates a vendor across multiple dimensions, including:

- Control environment strength  
- Data sensitivity and volume  
- Regulatory exposure  
- Operational dependency  
- Technology surface area  
- Past incidents or known weaknesses  

Each factor contributes to an overall **Risk Score**, which automatically maps to a **Vendor Tier** (Low, Moderate, High, Critical).

## 🎯 Why This Matters in TPRM  
Organizations rely on consistent risk scoring so that:

- High-risk vendors receive deeper due diligence  
- Low-risk vendors avoid unnecessary workload  
- Audit traceability and repeatability are preserved  
- Procurement, Legal, and Security have a shared language  
- Risk decisions can be defended to regulators and auditors  

This model mirrors those used by modern Vendor Risk, GRC, and Security Assurance teams.

## 🧩 Components Included  
This project contains all core elements of a complete scoring model:

1. **Methodology** – How scoring works and how weights are applied  
2. **Scoring Model** – Likelihood × impact matrix with factor definitions  
3. **Risk Heatmap** – Visual tier mapping for quick decision interpretation  
4. **Example Scoring** – Sample vendors scored using the framework  
5. **Summary** – Final conclusions and recommended usage patterns  

## 🛠 How to Use This Model  
- Apply the scoring model during initial vendor due diligence  
- Reassess vendors annually or after major changes  
- Use the heatmap to determine appropriate vendor tier  
- Record results for audit readiness and evidence tracking  
- Align remediation efforts based on final risk score
