# Vendor Risk Scoring Model – Summary  
This document provides an executive-level summary of the vendor risk scoring methodology, how it is applied, and what outcomes it produces within a Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) program.

---

## 1. Purpose of the Scoring Model  
The Vendor Risk Scoring Model allows organizations to:  
- Classify vendors consistently and objectively  
- Determine due diligence requirements (SOC 2, ISO, questionnaires)  
- Prioritize remediation efforts  
- Support audit readiness and regulatory expectations  
- Communicate risk clearly to stakeholders  

This model ensures vendors are evaluated using standardized criteria aligned with SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, and common TPRM practices.

---

## 2. Scoring Components  
The scoring model evaluates vendors across four key risk domains:

### **2.1 Inherent Risk**  
Assesses the nature of the service before controls are reviewed.  
Factors include:  
- Data sensitivity  
- System access level  
- Business criticality  
- Hosting environment  
- Regulatory impact  

### **2.2 Control Strength**  
Measures maturity of vendor controls, including:  
- Access management  
- Encryption  
- Vulnerability management  
- Incident response  
- Logging and monitoring  
- Cloud configuration  

### **2.3 Likelihood**  
Estimates how probable a security failure or control breakdown may be.  
Scored based on:  
- Control design  
- Operational maturity  
- Audit evidence  
- Historical performance  

### **2.4 Impact**  
Evaluates potential consequences of a vendor security incident.  
Impact includes:  
- Operational disruption  
- Regulatory exposure  
- Data breach severity  
- Financial or reputational loss

## 3. Scoring Scale  
All scoring uses a standard 1 to 5 scale:

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Very Low Risk |
| **2** | Low Risk |
| **3** | Moderate Risk |
| **4** | High Risk |
| **5** | Critical Risk |

The final risk rating is calculated using:  
**Risk = Likelihood x Impact (factoring in control strength).**

---

## 4. Risk Rating Outcomes  
Final vendor scores fall into one of four tiers:  

| Tier | Risk Level | Required Actions |
|------|------------|------------------|
| **Tier 1** | Low Risk | Basic due diligence, annual monitoring |
| **Tier 2** | Moderate Risk | SOC 2 review, questionnaire, annual updates |
| **Tier 3** | High Risk | Full assessment, remediation plan, executive approval |
| **Tier 4** | Critical Risk | CISO/legal approval, continuous monitoring, reconsider service |

## 5. How the Model Is Used  
The scoring model supports the complete TPRM lifecycle:  
- Vendor intake and initial screening  
- Inherent risk determination  
- Control assessment and documentation  
- Risk scoring and heatmap visualization  
- Remediation planning  
- Ongoing monitoring and quarterly review  

It ensures consistency, reduces subjectivity, and aligns with regulatory guidance such as OCC, FDIC, and FFIEC expectations.

---

## 6. Key Benefits  
This risk scoring model provides:  
- A clear, defensible logic for vendor decisions  
- Repeatable and auditable workflows  
- Strong alignment with SOC 2, ISO, and NIST frameworks  
- Scalability for large vendor inventories  
- Easy integration with GRC tools (Archer, OneTrust, ProcessUnity)

---

## 7. Final Notes  
This scoring framework mirrors the models used by real-world security, compliance, and GRC teams.  
It demonstrates the ability to quantify vendor risk, communicate it to leadership, and maintain a structured, mature Third-Party Risk Management program.
