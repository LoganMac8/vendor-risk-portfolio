# TPRM Risk Fundamentals  
_A practical guide to the concepts used in vendor risk assessments_

This document summarizes the core risk management concepts used in Vendor Risk / TPRM programs.

---

## Inherent vs Residual Risk
**Inherent Risk:**  
The level of risk before any controls are applied.

**Residual Risk:**  
The level of risk after evaluating the vendor’s controls.

In Vendor Risk assessments, inherent risk determines vendor tiering.  
Residual risk determines whether the vendor is “safe to use.”

## Risk Categories
Common categories:
- Security Risk  
- Privacy Risk  
- Operational Risk  
- Compliance Risk  
- Financial Risk  
- Concentration Risk  
- Reputational Risk  

---

## Risk Identification
How to identify vendor risks:
- Review SOC 2, ISO, or security documentation  
- Analyze the data types involved  
- Understand vendor dependencies  
- Review cloud/shared-responsibility model  
- Evaluate incident response and business continuity  

---

## Risk Analysis
Determine:
- **Likelihood**: How likely is the risk to occur?  
- **Impact**: What happens if it does?

Most programs use a 1–5 scale.

---

## Risk Evaluation & Treatment
Treatment options:
- Mitigate (remediation)  
- Accept  
- Transfer (e.g., insurance)  
- Avoid (do not use vendor)

---

## Supply Chain Risk
Vendors often rely on **subservice providers** (e.g., AWS, Azure).  
This introduces:
- Shared responsibility  
- Dependency risk  
- Data propagation  

---

## Cloud Risk Fundamentals
Understand:
- SaaS, PaaS, IaaS  
- Encryption  
- Authentication  
- Logging/monitoring  
- Business continuity  
- SLAs and uptime guarantees  

---

## Final Summary
Vendor Risk Analysts don’t manage enterprise risk — they evaluate **third-party** risk.  
The goal is to understand how a vendor protects your data, and whether residual risk is acceptable.
