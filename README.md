# Vendor Risk Analyst Portfolio

This repository showcases my hands-on work in Vendor Risk Management (VRM), including SOC 2 reviews, ISO 27001 vendor-related controls, vendor security questionnaires, and third-party risk scoring models. It is being built as part of an accelerated 21-day Vendor Risk / GRC blitz.
