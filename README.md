# Vendor Risk Analyst Portfolio  
_By Logan McDermott_

Welcome to my Vendor Risk & GRC Analyst portfolio. This repository documents my hands-on work with SOC 2, ISO 27001, vendor questionnaires, risk scoring models, and real-world assessment workflows. Everything here reflects how I approach third-party risk analysis — clear, structured, evidence-driven, and aligned with industry best practices.

My goal is simple: build the practical skills and muscle memory needed to operate confidently in a Vendor Risk or GRC Analyst role from day one.

## 🔎 What This Portfolio Demonstrates
This repository highlights my ability to:

- Review and analyze SOC 2 Type II reports  
- Interpret Trust Service Criteria and map them to real controls  
- Evaluate ISO 27001 controls relevant to vendor risk  
- Build vendor questionnaires and due diligence workflows  
- Create risk scoring models and heatmaps  
- Summarize complex security evidence in plain language  
- Document risks, exceptions, and remediation requirements  
- Think like an auditor and communicate like a risk analyst  

Everything is written in my own words and reflects how I would perform these tasks in a real program.

## 📘 Featured Work

### **1. SOC 2 Report Analysis**  
A full breakdown of a real SOC 2 Type II report (Cloudflare), including:  
- Scope  
- System description  
- Controls tested  
- Exceptions summarized safely  
- My risk conclusion and reasoning  

This demonstrates my ability to read audits the same way a Vendor Risk Analyst would.

---

### **2. Vendor Risk Scoring Model**  
I built a scoring model based on likelihood × impact, including:  
- Clear rating criteria  
- Risk heatmap  
- Example scoring scenarios  
- How the score drives vendor approval decisions  

This shows I understand both the analytical and practical side of vendor evaluation.

---

### **3. Vendor Security Questionnaire**  
A 25-question due diligence questionnaire covering:  
- Access control  
- Logging & monitoring  
- Encryption  
- HR & onboarding  
- Incident response  
- Business continuity  

This reflects the type of security screening companies use before onboarding third-party vendors.

---

### **4. ISO 27001 Control Mappings**  
A practical guide mapping ISO 27001 Annex A controls to vendor risk workflows.  
This demonstrates I understand not just the framework, but *how to apply it*.

---

### **5. Learning Journal (10-Day Blitz)**  
Daily notes and reflections showing:  
- What I studied  
- How I analyzed evidence  
- What challenged me  
- What I improved  
- How my vendor risk thinking evolved  

Hiring managers love seeing structured, consistent documentation — it shows discipline and real interest in the field.
