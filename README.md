# Third-Party Risk Analyst Portfolio  
### Security & Third-Party Risk Assessment — Cloudflare  
**By Logan McDermott**

This portfolio demonstrates my practical ability to perform end-to-end Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) activities, including vendor onboarding, due diligence, SOC 2 analysis, risk scoring, policy development, and executive reporting.  
It showcases the types of deliverables I would produce as a Third-Party Risk Analyst within a GRC or cybersecurity program.

# 1. Purpose of This Portfolio
This repository documents my workflow, methodology, and completed assessments while learning and practicing real-world TPRM processes.  
Every artifact mirrors what an enterprise security or compliance team expects during a formal vendor review.

My goals with this portfolio:
- Build hands-on experience using real frameworks (SOC 2, TSC, ISO, TPRM governance)
- Document a complete vendor assessment cycle from intake to approval
- Demonstrate clear, professional communication through structured deliverables
- Present work in a format that aligns with consulting and enterprise GRC standards

# 2. Featured Assessment: Cloudflare (2024)
This assessment is based entirely on **public Cloudflare documentation** and **non-confidential SOC 2 summaries**, following industry best practices for security reviews.

### Included Analysis Components:
- **Inherent risk evaluation**
- **25-question vendor security questionnaire**
- **Likelihood × Impact scoring model**
- **High-level SOC 2 review (safe, paraphrased)**
