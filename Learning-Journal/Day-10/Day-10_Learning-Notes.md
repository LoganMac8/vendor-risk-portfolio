DAY 10 – LEARNING JOURNAL  
NOTES  
--------------------------------------------------

FOCUS AREAS TODAY:
• Third-Party Risk Management workflows  
• Vendor intake forms and security questionnaires  
• SOC 2 and ISO 27001 control alignment  
• Access control, logging/monitoring, and incident response fundamentals  
• Proper formatting for audit-ready documentation  
• Understanding inherent vs residual risk scoring  

--------------------------------------------------
WHAT I WORKED ON:
• Refined several Vendor Risk documents (intake form, security questionnaire).  
• Rebuilt formatting using double-spaced non-collapsing structure.  
• Reviewed core TPRM evidence types (SOC 2, ISO, pen test, IR plans).  
• Studied cloud security shared responsibility concepts.  
• Practiced mapping controls across SOC 2 & ISO frameworks.  

--------------------------------------------------
KEY CONCEPTS LEARNED:
• Inherent vs Residual Risk  
  - Inherent = pre-control risk  
  - Residual = post-control risk  
• Intake form → Questionnaire → Evidence Review → Assessment → Rating  
• Subprocessor management is mandatory for TPRM compliance.  
• Incident Response maturity includes:
  - defined roles  
  - 12-month testing  
  - structured notification processes  
• Cloud security requires ongoing config reviews (CIS benchmarks, scanning).  

--------------------------------------------------
SKILLS STRENGTHENED:
• Writing clean vendor documentation  
• Interpreting SOC 2 criteria (“Security & Availability”)  
• Thinking like a risk assessor (identify → classify → score → remediate)  
• Building standardized templates for a real TPRM program
