# ISO 27001 in 20 Minutes  
_What Vendor Risk Analysts actually need to know_

ISO 27001 is a globally recognized security framework.  
Vendors often use ISO certification as evidence that they have a mature security program.

You DO NOT need to learn ISO implementation, auditing, or PDCA.

---

## What ISO 27001 Is
A security standard that defines:
- An Information Security Management System (ISMS)
- A set of controls (Annex A)

---

## Annex A (The Only Parts You Need)
Vendor Risk Analysts only care about:

- **A.5 — Policies**  
Does the vendor have documented security policies?

- **A.6 — Organization of Information Security**  
Who is responsible for approving access and authorizing changes?

- **A.7 — HR Security**  
Do employees get background checks and training?

- **A.8 — Asset Management**  
Does the vendor classify data and inventory their assets?

- **A.9 — Access Control**  
Least privilege, MFA, access reviews.

- **A.15 — Supplier Relationships**  
How the vendor manages *their* vendors (subprocessors).

## Why ISO Matters in Vendor Assessments
It helps you:
- Validate vendor maturity  
- Interpret SOC 2 controls  
- Understand questionnaire responses  
- Evaluate access control, HR onboarding, and data protection  

---

## Mapping ISO to SOC 2
Examples:
- ISO A.9 (Access Control) → SOC 2 CC6.x  
- ISO A.8 (Asset Management) → SOC 2 CC1.x  
- ISO A.7 (HR Security) → SOC 2 CC4.x  

---

## Final Takeaway
You do NOT need ISO Lead Implementer or auditor knowledge.  
You only need ISO **awareness**, which this document covers completely.
