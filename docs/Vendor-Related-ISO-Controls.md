Vendor Related ISO 27001 Controls

ISO 27001 includes a set of security controls found in Annex A. Vendor Risk Analysts only need to focus on the controls that relate to suppliers, operations, governance, and data protection. These controls help determine whether a vendor is managing information securely and meeting compliance expectations.

A.5 Organizational Controls
A.5.1 Information Security Policies

Vendors must maintain documented and approved security policies that are reviewed on a regular schedule. This establishes a clear governance structure.

A.5.7 Contact with Authorities

Vendors must understand how to reach regulators or law enforcement during security incidents or compliance matters.

A.5.8 Contact with Special Interest Groups

Shows whether vendors stay informed about industry trends, threat intelligence, and evolving best practices.

A.6 People Controls
A.6.3 Information Security Awareness, Education, and Training

Vendor personnel must receive recurrent security training to reduce risks involving human error, phishing, and social engineering.

A.6.4 Disciplinary Process

Vendors must have formal actions for employees who violate security rules or policies.

A.8 Operations Controls
A.8.8 Management of Technical Vulnerabilities

Vendors must scan for vulnerabilities, apply patches, and act on findings in a timely manner.

A.8.9 Configuration Management

Systems must be securely configured and monitored to prevent unauthorized changes.

A.8.11 Backup

Vendors must keep reliable and tested backups to support business continuity and recovery.

A.8.16 Monitoring Activities

Ongoing monitoring helps detect suspicious behavior or potential unauthorized access.

A.10 Technical Controls
A.10.1 Cryptographic Controls

Vendors must use proper encryption methods to protect sensitive data during storage and transfer.

A.10.9 Secure Configuration of Network Services

Network components must be designed and configured securely with proper segmentation and protections.

A.10.10 Logging and Monitoring

Log data must be collected, stored, and reviewed to detect anomalies or malicious activity.

A.10.12 Data Leakage Prevention

Controls must exist to prevent accidental or intentional exposure of sensitive information.

A.15 Supplier Relationships

This is the most important control set for Vendor Risk Analysts.

A.15.1 Supplier Security Requirements

Organizations must define the expected security controls vendors must have. These are usually written into contracts or service agreements.

A.15.2 Supplier Onboarding and Lifecycle Management

Covers due diligence, onboarding, ongoing assessments, and offboarding procedures for vendors.

A.15.3 Monitoring and Review of Suppliers

Organizations must review vendor performance, compliance, and overall security posture on a recurring basis.

A.15.4 Managing Changes to Supplier Services

Any changes to vendor services, scope, or infrastructure must undergo security impact evaluation.

Summary

Vendor related ISO controls help determine whether a vendor is capable of protecting information, meeting security expectations, and maintaining reliable operations. For Vendor Risk Analysts, the most critical controls are found in A.15, which governs supplier security across the entire vendor lifecycle.
