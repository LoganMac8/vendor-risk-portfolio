# Exceptions and Impact Analysis  
Safe, paraphrased summary of observed control deviations

This document outlines the exceptions identified in the SOC 2 testing results, along with analysis of their cause, impact, and recommended remediation steps. No confidential or vendor specific details are disclosed.

## Exception 1: Periodic Review Performed Late

### Why the Control Failed  
A scheduled review activity was completed after the expected due date. Evidence showed this was a one time timing issue rather than a full process breakdown.

### Impact  
Impact: Low.  
The delay did not prevent the control from operating overall and did not affect data confidentiality or system security.

### Risk Severity  
Low

### Recommended Remediation  
- Automate reminders for recurring security tasks  
- Track recurring tasks with clear ownership and due dates  
- Document late completions and reasons for transparency  

---

## Exception 2: Documentation Not Fully Updated

### Why the Control Failed  
Supporting documentation for a security control contained outdated sections and did not reflect the most recent process revisions.

### Impact  
Impact: Low.  
Although the documentation lagged behind, the control itself was operating effectively.

### Risk Severity  
Low

### Recommended Remediation  
- Update outdated policy and procedure documents  
- Implement an annual documentation review cycle  
- Assign specific documentation owners for key processes  

---

## Exception 3: Single Deviation in Control Execution

### Why the Control Failed  
A task associated with an operational control was missed once during the audit period but completed consistently for all other cycles.

### Impact  
Impact: Low to moderate, depending on context.  
No incidents resulted from the missed instance, but it highlights reliance on manual checks.

### Risk Severity  
Low

### Recommended Remediation  
- Add automation where practical for recurring tasks  
- Introduce peer review for recurring operational tasks  
- Add a secondary approval or verification step for high impact controls

## Overall Risk Conclusion

The exceptions identified do not indicate systemic control failures. All deviations were isolated, low impact, and can be addressed through standard remediation steps.

Combined Risk Rating: Low  
Recommended Vendor Status: Approved with minor follow up items
