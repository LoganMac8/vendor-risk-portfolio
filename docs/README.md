# Documentation Overview

This folder contains supporting documentation that shows how I think and communicate as a Vendor Risk and GRC Analyst. These files are not meant to be formal reports for customers, but internal style references that demonstrate my understanding of core concepts and how I would document them on the job.

Each document is written in my own words and focused on clarity, structure, and practical use.

## File Guide

### SOC2-Basics.md  
A practical overview of SOC 2 written for Vendor Risk work.  
Covers what SOC 2 is, why Type II matters more than Type I, which sections of a report are most important, and how to use SOC 2 during due diligence.  
This shows my ability to explain frameworks clearly to non-technical stakeholders.

### SOC2-Trust-Criteria-Explained.md  
Breaks down the SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria into Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy.  
Focuses on examples, typical risks, and how each area affects vendor risk scoring.  
This demonstrates framework fluency and the ability to connect controls to real risk.

### SOC2_Report_Analysis.md  
My written analysis of a real SOC 2 Type II report, focused on scope, system description, subservice organizations, controls tested, and exceptions.  
All commentary is paraphrased and written as a Vendor Risk Analyst would document internal notes.  
This shows how I would review and summarize a SOC 2 report in a real workflow.

### SOC2_Findings.md  
A findings style summary based on review of a SOC 2 report.  
Highlights control strengths, minor issues, and an overall risk conclusion.  
This demonstrates how I would write a concise findings section for leadership or a risk committee.

### Exceptions_and_Impacts.md  
Structured analysis of observed control exceptions with cause, impact, severity, and remediation recommendations.  
Written to be safe and generic, without vendor specific details.  
This shows how I think about exceptions, risk levels, and practical remediation.

### Vendor-Related-ISO-Controls.md  
Focuses on ISO 27001 controls that matter most for Vendor Risk and third party assessments.  
Connects ISO controls to vendor due diligence, evidence collection, and ongoing monitoring.  
This demonstrates that I understand ISO in a focused, vendor oriented way rather than at a purely academic level.

### What-a-Vendor-Risk-Analyst-Does.md  
Plain language explanation of the Vendor Risk Analyst role, including intake, evidence review, risk documentation, remediation requests, and monitoring.  
Written so that someone outside security could understand what the role actually does.  
This reflects how I see the day to day responsibilities of the job.

### TPRM_Risk_Fundamentals.md  
High level overview of Third Party Risk Management concepts, including vendor tiering, inherent vs residual risk, and the use of questionnaires and scoring models.  
This shows that I understand how individual assessments fit into a broader TPRM program.
