How to Review a SOC 2 Report

A SOC 2 report evaluates whether a service organization has effective controls for protecting customer data. Vendor Risk Analysts review SOC 2 reports to determine if a vendor can be approved, whether risks exist, and whether remediation is required.
This guide explains the exact steps used to review a SOC 2 report in a real Vendor Risk workflow.

Step One Understand the Report Type

SOC 2 reports come in two versions.
Type One evaluates the design of controls at a point in time.
Type Two evaluates both the design and the operating effectiveness of controls over a period of time.

Type Two provides better assurance and is preferred for vendor assessments.

Step Two Confirm the Scope

Identify which systems and services the auditor evaluated.
Scope determines whether the vendor assessed the exact product or environment your company will use.

Look for the following items
• System description
• Services included and excluded
• Boundaries of the environment
• Infrastructure components
• Software components
• People and processes in scope

A limited or unclear scope increases risk.

Step Three Review the Trust Service Criteria

Verify which TSC categories the vendor included.
Security is always included.
Availability, Confidentiality, Processing Integrity, and Privacy are optional.

More TSC categories can provide broader assurance.

Step Four Evaluate the Control Activities

Read how the vendor’s controls are designed.
Look for maturity indicators such as
• Access control and least privilege
• Logging and monitoring
• Change management
• Encryption and key management
• Vulnerability management and patching
• Incident response readiness
• Backup and recovery processes

Controls should match the vendor’s risk level and the sensitivity of the data they handle.

Step Five Review the Auditor’s Testing and Results

In a Type Two report, auditors test controls for months.
Focus on the following
• Tests performed
• Results of each test
• Any exceptions or failures
• Auditor comments
• Root cause explanations
• Severity of findings

Not every exception is critical, but repeated or systemic issues increase risk.

Step Six Identify Exceptions and Required Remediation

Document any issues that impact your organization.
Common exceptions involve
• Incomplete access reviews
• Delayed patching
• Missing logs or monitoring gaps
• Weak change management processes
• Outdated policies

Determine whether the vendor has provided a remediation plan.
If not, remediation must be requested before approval.

Step Seven Review Complementary User Entity Controls

These are responsibilities your organization must perform for the vendor’s controls to remain effective.
Examples include
• Enforcing strong authentication for your users
• Restricting access to vendor portals
• Maintaining secure network configurations
• Reviewing vendor access regularly

Your organization must implement these controls to avoid gaps.

Step Eight Form Your Risk Conclusion

Summarize the findings in plain language.
Include
• Whether the SOC 2 is acceptable
• Any risks discovered
• Likelihood and impact ratings
• Required remediation
• Final approval or rejection guidance

Your conclusion is what leadership relies on to make decisions.

Summary

Reviewing a SOC 2 report involves understanding the scope, evaluating the Trust Service Criteria, analyzing control effectiveness, reviewing exceptions, and forming a clear risk conclusion. This process helps determine whether a vendor’s security posture meets organizational requirements and whether additional remediation is needed before onboarding.
