What a Vendor Risk Analyst Does

A Vendor Risk Analyst evaluates third-party vendors to ensure they meet security, compliance, and operational standards before and after a company begins working with them. The role focuses on reducing risk from external partners, SaaS providers, cloud services, and suppliers that store, process, or access company data.

Vendor Risk Analysts support governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) by assessing vendors, identifying gaps, and helping drive remediation.

Core Responsibilities
1. Vendor Onboarding & Due Diligence

During the onboarding phase, analysts evaluate whether a vendor is safe to work with by reviewing:

SOC 2 reports

ISO 27001 certifications

Security questionnaires (SIG Lite, CAIQ, custom)

Penetration test summaries

Security policies (access control, encryption, incident response)

The goal is to verify the vendor has appropriate controls in place.

2. Reviewing Security & Compliance Evidence

Analysts validate that vendors meet required security standards by analyzing:

Trust Service Criteria within SOC 2

Vendor-related Annex A controls in ISO 27001

Data protection practices

Business continuity plans

Incident response maturity

This determines whether the vendor can protect company and customer data.

3. Risk Scoring & Vendor Tiering

Analysts assign risk levels based on:

Likelihood × Impact

Data sensitivity

Access level

Operational dependency

Security posture

Vendors are categorized (Low, Medium, High, Critical), and higher-tier vendors receive deeper assessments.

4. Identifying Gaps & Driving Remediation

When issues are found,missing controls, failed tests, outdated policies, the analyst:

Documents findings

Notifies the vendor

Requests remediation

Tracks the issue to closure

The goal is to reduce residual risk before approval.

5. Continuous Monitoring

Vendor risk doesn’t stop at onboarding. Analysts perform:

Annual reassessments

Monitoring of updated SOC 2 reports

Review of new incidents or breaches

Risk score adjustments

Updates to compliance documentation

This ensures vendors stay compliant over time.

Summary

Vendor Risk Analysts protect organizations by ensuring third-party vendors operate securely and follow industry standards like SOC 2 and ISO 27001. The role blends technical understanding, risk assessment, documentation, and communication to safeguard data and reduce external risk.
