# What a Vendor Risk Analyst Does  
A practical explanation of the role

Vendor Risk Analysts help protect an organization from security, privacy, and operational risks introduced by third party vendors. Any time a company uses a cloud service, payment provider, software platform, or niche tool, someone needs to evaluate that vendor's security posture before data is shared.

This overview explains what Vendor Risk Analysts typically do day to day and how they contribute to a stronger risk posture.

## 1. Review Vendors Before Approval

Before a contract is signed, Vendor Risk Analysts perform due diligence to determine whether a vendor is safe to use.

Typical evidence includes:

- SOC 2 reports  
- ISO 27001 certifications  
- Security questionnaires  
- Penetration test summaries  
- Architecture diagrams  
- Data flow explanations  

The goal is to understand how the vendor protects data and whether they meet the organization's minimum security requirements.

## 2. Identify Risks and Gaps

After gathering evidence, the analyst reviews it for potential risks, such as:

- Weak access control  
- Limited or missing logging  
- Delayed patching  
- Unclear data retention or deletion processes  
- Lack of MFA  
- Outdated policies  
- Heavy dependence on high risk subservice providers  

These findings are documented along with an assessment of likelihood and impact to form a clear risk rating.

## 3. Request Remediation When Needed

If gaps are identified, the analyst recommends or requests specific improvements. Examples include:

- Enabling MFA  
- Encrypting data at rest  
- Completing overdue access or permissions reviews  
- Updating or formalizing security policies  
- Expanding monitoring coverage  

The goal is not to reject every vendor with a gap, but to help them come into alignment with the organization's standards.

## 4. Communicate Risk in Plain Language

A large part of the role is explaining security risks in a way that non technical stakeholders can understand.

Vendor Risk Analysts often work with:

- Procurement  
- Legal  
- Business owners  
- Engineering  
- Leadership  

These groups rely on the analyst's written summaries and recommendations to make final decisions. Good Vendor Risk Analysts can translate technical findings into clear, business friendly language.

## 5. Monitor High Risk Vendors Over Time

Review does not end once a vendor is approved. Vendors are re evaluated periodically, especially those classified as high risk.

Ongoing monitoring can include:

- Tracking remediation progress  
- Reviewing updated SOC 2 or ISO reports  
- Monitoring for incidents or public breach notifications  
- Reviewing scope changes or new services  

This ongoing view helps catch new risks early and ensures the vendor continues to meet expectations.

## 6. Maintain Vendor Risk Documentation

Analysts maintain organized and audit ready records, including:

- Risk assessments  
- Due diligence notes  
- Questionnaires and responses  
- Approval or rejection decisions  
- Remediation tracking  
- Vendor tiering or criticality classifications  

Good documentation is important for internal audits, external reviews, and general transparency.

## 7. Support and Improve the Third Party Risk Program

Vendor Risk Analysts often help refine and scale the overall program by contributing to:

- Policies and procedures  
- Vendor intake forms and workflows  
- Questionnaires and scoring models  
- Risk dashboards and heatmaps  
- Contract language guidance for security requirements  
- Internal training materials  

As the company grows, these processes need adjustment and improvement, and analysts are often close enough to the work to see what needs to change.

## Why This Role Matters

Organizations depend heavily on third party vendors. If a critical vendor has a security incident, outage, or data leak, the impact can be direct and significant.

Vendor Risk Analysts help reduce the chance and impact of:

- Data exposure  
- Downtime  
- Compliance failures  
- Financial loss  
- Reputational harm  

By reviewing security documentation, identifying risks, recommending remediation, and continuously monitoring vendors, Vendor Risk Analysts play a central role in maintaining a strong overall security posture and managing supply chain risk.
