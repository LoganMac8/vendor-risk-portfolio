SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria (TSC) — Explained

The SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria (TSC) are the foundation used to evaluate whether a service organization’s security controls are designed and operating effectively. Vendor Risk Analysts use the TSC to understand how a vendor protects customer data, what risks may exist, and whether compensating controls are in place.

SOC 2 has five Trust Service Criteria:

1. Security (Common Criteria — CC Series)

Required for all SOC 2 reports.

Security ensures systems and data are protected against unauthorized access.
Examples of controls include:

Access control and least privilege

Network protection (firewalls, segmentation)

Multi-factor authentication

Logging and monitoring

Change management

Vulnerability management

Why it matters:
Security shows whether a vendor can protect your data from breaches, misuse, or unauthorized activity.

2. Availability

Availability ensures systems and services remain operational and meet commitments.

Controls often include:

Uptime SLAs

Capacity planning

Incident response

Disaster recovery and business continuity

Why it matters:
A vendor might have strong security but an unreliable infrastructure. Availability ensures they can stay online and deliver services without major outages.

3. Confidentiality

Confidentiality protects data designated as confidential from unauthorized disclosure.

Controls include:

Data encryption (at rest & in transit)

Data classification

Secure data retention & disposal

Restricted access to sensitive data

Why it matters:
Vendors often store internal business data, contracts, financial information, or PII that must not leak.

4. Processing Integrity

Processing Integrity ensures systems process data accurately, completely, and in a timely manner.

Controls include:

Input/output validation

Error handling

System monitoring

Quality assurance

Why it matters:
If a vendor processes transactions, analytics, financial data, or automation workflows, integrity failures could corrupt outputs or cause financial harm.

5. Privacy

Privacy focuses on how personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed of in alignment with privacy commitments.

Controls include:

Consent management

Notice and transparency

Data minimization

Individual rights (access, correction, deletion)

Why it matters:
Vendors handling personal data must comply with regulations like GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, COPPA, etc.

How SOC 2 TSC Are Used in Vendor Risk

As a Vendor Risk Analyst, you review SOC 2 reports to identify:

Which TSC were included

Which systems were evaluated

Whether controls passed or had exceptions

Whether issues require remediation

Whether the vendor is safe to approve

This provides an evidence-based way to assess a vendor’s security posture.
