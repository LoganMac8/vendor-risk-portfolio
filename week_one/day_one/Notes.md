Today I focused on understanding the role of a Vendor Risk Analyst and the overall purpose of Vendor Risk Management. A Vendor Risk Analyst evaluates third party vendors to ensure that security controls are effective, data is protected, and risks are identified before the business begins using a service.

I learned the vendor lifecycle from onboarding through continuous monitoring. This includes collecting intake information, reviewing SOC Two reports, evaluating questionnaires, scoring risk, driving remediation, and maintaining ongoing oversight.

I set up my GitHub portfolio and created the structure that I will use throughout the Blitz. This included folders for documentation, questionnaires, projects, and risk models. I also added my first core files that explain the Vendor Risk role and supporting frameworks.

I reviewed several real job descriptions to understand what employers expect. Common themes include SOC Two knowledge, ISO familiarity, the ability to interpret control evidence, risk scoring, strong communication, and documentation skills. These are exactly what the Blitz focuses on.

Overall, Day one established a clear understanding of the job and the workflow and created the foundation for the rest of Week one.
