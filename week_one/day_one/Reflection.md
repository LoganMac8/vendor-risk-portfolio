Day one reflection

Today helped me build a clear understanding of what a Vendor Risk Analyst actually does and why the role is important. I learned that the job is a mix of security evaluation, documentation, communication, and decision making. It requires attention to detail and the ability to understand how vendors protect data and support the business.

The Vendor Risk lifecycle made sense once I saw how the steps connect from intake through onboarding and into continuous monitoring. I understand now that the work does not end after the first assessment. It is a process that continues as the vendor changes, as the environment changes, and as new risks appear.

Setting up my GitHub portfolio helped me see how everything will fit together during the Blitz. Organizing the folders and creating the base files made me feel more confident and prepared for the rest of the week. This step also helped me see how much documentation is involved in this career path.

Reviewing job descriptions gave me a realistic view of what employers expect. It was interesting to see the same themes repeated across different companies such as understanding SOC Two, reading security evidence, scoring risk, and communicating findings clearly. This showed me that I am working on the exact skills that matter.

Overall, I feel motivated and confident after day one. Some parts felt completely new, but nothing felt overwhelming. I can see the path clearly, and the work feels achievable. I am ready to move into day two and start learning the Trust Service Criteria in detail.
