# Day 8 — Notes  
## Resume + LinkedIn Optimization (Vendor Risk Edition)

### 1. Building My Vendor Risk Resume
Today’s focus was turning everything I’ve created over the past week into a clean, professional resume tailored for Third-Party Risk Analyst and GRC roles.

Key items added:

- **SOC 2 Analysis (Strong)**  
  Highlighting understanding of audit structure, TSC, exceptions, and evidence interpretation.

- **TPRM Fundamentals**  
  Experience with risk scoring, questionnaires, due diligence, intake forms, policy writing.

- **Cloud Shared Responsibility Model**  
  Understanding of customer vs vendor responsibilities, especially relevant for SaaS risk reviews.

- **Vendor Assessment Project (Cloudflare)**  
  Full end-to-end third-party risk review, including risk scoring and recommendations.

- **SOC 2 Analysis Project**  
  High-level, NDA-safe assessment modeled after real corporate workflows.

- **Vendor Policy Suite Project**  
  Four fully drafted policies demonstrating governance and process understanding.

I restructured the resume to emphasize skills and deliverables instead of job titles, making the document experience-based.

### 2. LinkedIn Headline + About Section
I drafted a headline that aligns with recruiter searches:

**“Aspiring Third-Party Risk Analyst | SOC 2 | GRC | Vendor Risk | Cloud Security | Due Diligence & Risk Scoring”**

The About section focuses on:
- My portfolio work  
- Hands-on TPRM projects  
- Skills learned  
- My motivation  
- What I bring to a GRC or security team  

Everything was written in first-person and kept authentic.

### 3. Adding GitHub Projects to LinkedIn
I added the following to the Projects section:

- **Cloudflare Vendor Risk Assessment**  
- **SOC 2 High-Level Analysis**  
- **Vendor Policy Suite**  
- **TPRM Risk Scoring Model**

Each project includes:
- A short summary  
- Key skills demonstrated  
- A link to the GitHub repo  

This makes my LinkedIn interactive and portfolio-driven.

### 4. Recruiter Optimization (Keywords)
I updated my LinkedIn skills, headline, and About section to include the keywords recruiters use when searching:

- Vendor Risk  
- Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)  
- SOC 2  
- GRC  
- Cybersecurity  
- Cloud risk  
- Supply chain risk  
- Due diligence  
- Risk scoring  
- Security questionnaires  
- Compliance  

These significantly raise my chances of being found by automated screening tools.

### 5. Recruiter Outreach Plan
Began connecting with:

- GRC Managers  
- Vendor Risk Analysts  
- SOC Analysts  
- Cybersecurity Managers  
- Compliance leads  

Sent personalized but short connection messages:

“Hi [Name], I’m building my Vendor Risk skills and just completed a full Cloudflare vendor assessment. I’d love to connect and learn from your experience.”
