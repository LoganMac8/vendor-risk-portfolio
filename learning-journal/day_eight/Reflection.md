# Day 8 — Reflection

Today was a shift from building technical work to presenting myself professionally, and it made me realize how much the delivery matters. It doesn't matter how strong my Cloudflare assessment or SOC 2 analysis is if recruiters can’t immediately understand what I bring to the table.

Building my resume with a Vendor Risk focus helped me consolidate everything I’ve learned so far. Listing the Cloudflare Assessment, SOC 2 Analysis, Risk Scoring Model, and Policy Suite made me see how much real work I’ve created in just a few days. It honestly looks like the type of portfolio someone would build after a year in a junior GRC role.

LinkedIn was another eye-opener. I didn’t realize how important keyword optimization was until I started writing out my headline and skills. By thinking like a recruiter, “What would I type into LinkedIn if I needed a TPRM candidate?” I finally understood how to position myself. It’s not about sounding fancy; it’s about sounding *findable*.

The best part of today was connecting with real GRC and Vendor Risk professionals. Seeing their profiles made me feel like I’m actually entering this field, not just studying it. I’m starting to understand the community, the job expectations, and how people actually talk about their work.

Overall, today helped me bridge the gap between *knowing the skills* and *showing the skills.* I feel more confident now that I’m building a real professional identity in the Vendor Risk space.
