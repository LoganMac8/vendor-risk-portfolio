# Day 9 Reflection

Today marked a real shift from learning to actively pursuing the role. Sending out applications felt different now that my portfolio and resume finally look like something a real analyst would produce. Instead of doubting whether I’m ready, I now feel like I have actual proof of the skills I’ve been building.

Reviewing job descriptions is becoming easier and more intuitive. I can quickly spot which roles are truly Vendor Risk or GRC and which ones are mislabeled or too technical. This helped me target positions that align with my strengths and realistic entry points.

The recruiter outreach was surprisingly comfortable. Because I have real projects behind me, I’m not trying to “sell myself”; I’m simply showing the work I’ve done. Having the portfolio gives me confidence because it reflects the clarity and structure that these roles expect.

Interview prep at the end helped reinforce how far I’ve come. I’m now able to talk through vendor scoring, SOC 2 reviews, and due diligence in a way that sounds natural instead of memorized. The Cloudflare assessment especially feels like something I could walk a hiring manager through confidently.

Overall, Day 9 felt like momentum. This stopped being just training and started becoming the first real steps toward landing the role. I feel good about where I am and excited to see the first responses come in.
