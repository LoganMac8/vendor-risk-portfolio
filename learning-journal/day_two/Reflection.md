## 🌟 What Felt Strong Today
Today I made noticeable progress in understanding how SOC 2 reports are structured and how auditors think when evaluating controls. Breaking down sections like the auditor’s opinion, system description, and test results felt much more intuitive by the end of the session.  
I’m also getting better at identifying what matters most in a SOC 2 report and what is simply background information. This is helping me build the perspective of a Vendor Risk Analyst rather than just a learner.

## 🔍 What Challenged Me
Understanding subservice organizations took some time. The difference between inclusive vs carve-out reporting isn’t complicated, but seeing how it impacts scope and responsibility required some focus.  
Additionally, interpreting exceptions in a meaningful way—beyond simply noticing that they exist—was challenging at first. It’s becoming clearer how each exception carries context about the maturity of the vendor’s program.

## 🧠 What I Learned About Myself
- I learn best when I compare multiple examples rather than relying on one sample report.  
- Taking time to rewrite concepts in my own words helps them stick.  
- I’m more detail-oriented than I realized—spotting control gaps is becoming easier with practice.

## 🚀 Progress Toward Becoming Job-Ready
Today’s study session pushed me closer to thinking like an auditor. I’m starting to recognize patterns in control failures and understand how they tie back to risk levels.  
This is essential for building strong portfolio projects later in the blitz, especially my SOC 2 analysis PDF and vendor assessment.

## 🎯 What I Want to Improve Tomorrow
- Improve clarity and confidence when explaining exceptions and their impact.  
- Get better at writing concise remediation recommendations.  
- Practice mapping SOC 2 controls to Trust Service Criteria more naturally.

## 💬 Final Thought
Today was a deep dive into how professionals evaluate real security evidence. It was challenging but rewarding, and I’m starting to feel more confident in my ability to review SOC 2 reports like an analyst rather than simply reading them at surface level.
