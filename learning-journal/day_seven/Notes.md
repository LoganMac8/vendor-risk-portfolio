# Day 7 — Notes  
## Portfolio Project: Vendor Policy Suite

### 1. Purpose of Today’s Work
The goal today was to build the core policies that support a full Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) program.  
These policies set expectations for how an organization evaluates, approves, monitors, and offboards vendors.

Building them myself helped me understand the structure and the “why” behind TPRM governance.

### 2. Supplier Security Policy
This policy defines:

- Vendor onboarding requirements  
- Documentation and evidence expectations  
- Required security controls for suppliers  
- Continuous monitoring expectations  
- Offboarding processes for when a vendor relationship ends  

The key point is that the organization must establish a minimum baseline of required controls before bringing any vendor into the environment.

---

### 3. Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) Policy
This policy outlines:

- Vendor tiering (Low / Medium / High / Critical)  
- Due diligence levels required for each tier  
- When SOC 2, ISO, or questionnaires are required  
- Expectations for remediation  
- Annual / periodic review standards  

This is the backbone of a mature TPRM program and shows how policy drives consistent risk handling.

### 4. Data Handling Policy
This policy covers:

- Data classification  
- Retention and deletion practices  
- Encryption requirements  
- Secure transmission  
- Proper disposal and sanitization  

Data handling policies are essential when evaluating how vendors process, store, or transmit sensitive information.

---

### 5. Access Control Policy
This policy includes:

- MFA requirements  
- Least privilege expectations  
- Role-based access controls  
- User access review frequency  
- Termination and offboarding access removal  

This policy is one of the most commonly referenced documents in vendor reviews.

### 6. Policy Suite PDF Creation
After drafting each policy, I bundled them into one professionally formatted PDF:  
**`Policy_Suite.pdf`**

Sections were structured like real corporate policy documents:

- Purpose  
- Scope  
- Roles & Responsibilities  
- Requirements  
- Policy Enforcement  
- Review Cycle
