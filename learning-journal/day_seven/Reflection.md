# Day 7 — Reflection

Writing full policies today helped me understand just how important governance is in a mature TPRM program. Up until now, most of my learning has focused on evaluating vendors, scoring risk, and reviewing controls. But today showed me the foundation that makes all of that consistent and scalable: the policies themselves.

Organizations rely heavily on clear policies to make sure every vendor is evaluated the same way. Without strong baseline requirements, assessments would be inconsistent and subjective. Writing these policies from scratch forced me to think from the company’s perspective rather than the vendor’s.

I realized that policies are about establishing guardrails, not just for vendors, but also for internal teams who rely on the TPRM function. They clarify who does what, when it must be done, and how risk is communicated.

A big insight from today: **Good vendor risk management is more about process than tools.**  
Tools help, but the real structure comes from the policies that define intake, evidence collection, tiering, remediation, and offboarding.

Drafting these policies also made me more confident in my ability to work in a GRC setting. I now understand the rationale behind MFA requirements, classification standards, retention rules, and access review cycles, not just as technical controls, but as enforceable policy requirements.

Overall, today strengthened both my documentation skills and my understanding of TPRM governance. It made my portfolio more complete and helped me feel prepared to support a real vendor risk program.
