# Day Ten – Reflections

TODAY’S WINS:
• Produced polished, professional TPRM documents.  
• Fixed formatting issues across multiple templates.  
• Built momentum toward a complete Vendor Risk portfolio.  
• Developed a more strategic, risk-based mindset.  

CHALLENGES:
• Need deeper familiarity with ISO 27001 control groups.  
• Still improving at interpreting pen test summaries and mapping findings to risk scores.  
• Want more hands-on understanding of cloud-native security tools (GuardDuty, Azure Defender).

WHAT I’M PROUD OF:
• My documentation looks recruiter-ready and consistent.  
• I’m improving rapidly at identifying and articulating risk.  
• I can confidently describe the full TPRM lifecycle.  
• I’m building discipline and structure through daily learning logs.  

NEXT STEPS:
• Build Day 11 artifacts (Risk Register entry + Remediation Plan).  
• Continue SOC 2 <-> ISO 27001 mapping practice.  
• Begin assembling the portfolio into a clean GitHub structure.  
• Study shared responsibility models in more depth.
