# Day Ten – Learning Notes

FOCUS AREAS TODAY:
• Third-Party Risk Management workflows  
• Vendor intake forms and security questionnaires  
• SOC 2 and ISO 27001 control alignment  
• Access control, logging/monitoring, and incident response fundamentals  
• Proper formatting for audit-ready documentation  
• Understanding inherent vs residual risk scoring  

WHAT I WORKED ON:
• Refined several Vendor Risk documents (intake form, security questionnaire).  
• Rebuilt formatting using double-spaced, non-collapsing structure.  
• Reviewed core TPRM evidence types (SOC 2, ISO, pen test, IR plans).  
• Studied cloud security shared responsibility concepts.  
• Practiced mapping controls across SOC 2 & ISO frameworks.  

KEY CONCEPTS LEARNED:
• Inherent vs Residual Risk  
  - Inherent = pre-control risk  
  - Residual = post-control risk  

• TPRM workflow:  
  Intake Form → Questionnaire → Evidence Review → Assessment → Risk Rating  

• Subprocessor management is required for TPRM compliance.  

• Incident Response maturity indicators:  
  - Defined roles  
  - 12-month testing  
  - Structured notification processes  

• Cloud environments require ongoing config reviews (CIS benchmarks, automated scanning).  

SKILLS STRENGTHENED:
• Writing clean, structured vendor documentation  
• Understanding SOC 2 “Security & Availability” criteria  
• Thinking like a risk assessor (identify → classify → score → remediate)  
• Building standardized templates for a realistic TPRM program
