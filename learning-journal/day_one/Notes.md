# Day One — Learning Journal

**Focus Area:** SOC 2 Foundations & Trust Service Criteria  
**Daily Goal:** Build a strong understanding of SOC 2 structure, Type I vs Type II, and the purpose of the Trust Service Criteria.  
**Time Spent:** ~6 hours

## 📘 What I Studied Today
### **1. SOC 2 Introduction**
- What SOC 2 is and why companies use it  
- The purpose of SOC reporting  
- The difference between SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3  
- Why SOC 2 is the most relevant for Vendor Risk roles  

### **2. Type I vs Type II**
- **Type I:** Controls *designed effectively* at a point in time  
- **Type II:** Controls *designed and operating effectively* over 3–12 months  
- Why Vendor Risk teams prefer Type II reports  
- How Type II adds audit evidence and operational assurance  

### **3. Trust Service Criteria (TSC) Overview**
I studied all five categories and how they apply to vendors:
- **Security (Common Criteria)**
- **Availability**
- **Processing Integrity**
- **Confidentiality**
- **Privacy**

### **4. Deep Dive Into Security (Common Criteria)**
This category is required for all SOC 2 reports.  
Key concepts I learned:
- Access control  
- Logging & monitoring  
- Vulnerability management  
- Incident response  
- Change management

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- SOC 2 is less about checking boxes and more about evaluating whether an organization can **consistently protect customer data**.  
- Type II is significantly more valuable than Type I in Vendor Risk assessments.  
- The Trust Service Criteria form the backbone of SOC 2; most controls map directly to one or more criteria.  
- Understanding the structure of a SOC 2 report is critical for reading findings, exceptions, and control gaps.

## 🔍 What I Found Interesting
- The Security category overlaps heavily with ISO 27001 Annex A controls.  
- Many companies use the same evidence (MFA, access reviews, encryption policies) to satisfy both SOC 2 and ISO requirements.  
- The biggest value of SOC 2 is how it forces vendors to **document, monitor, and prove** their security practices.
