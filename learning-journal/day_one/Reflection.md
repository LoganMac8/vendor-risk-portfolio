# Day One — Reflection

**Focus Area:** SOC 2 Fundamentals & Trust Service Criteria  
**Date:** _{{add today’s date}}_

## 🌟 What Felt Strong Today
Today was a solid start. I understood the overall structure of SOC 2 much faster than expected, especially the differences between Type I and Type II reports. The Trust Service Criteria made sense once I saw how every control ties back to one of the five categories.  
I felt confident summarizing the concepts in my own words, and I’m already getting more comfortable translating audit frameworks into practical vendor risk language.

## 🔍 What Challenged Me
The biggest challenge was keeping track of how SOC 2 maps to real-world controls. There’s a lot of terminology (access control, monitoring, incident response, etc.), and each company implements these differently.  
I also noticed that the SOC 2 world overlaps heavily with ISO 27001, which is helpful but also adds more layers to keep organized.

## 🧠 What I Learned About Myself
- I learn faster when I take clean, structured notes.  
- Breaking concepts into “what it is,” “why it matters,” and “how it works” makes it easier to understand.  
- Documenting publicly on GitHub keeps me accountable and forces clarity.

## 🚀 Progress Toward Becoming Job-Ready
I’m starting to see how Vendor Risk Analysts actually think: evaluating evidence, reviewing controls, and identifying gaps based on frameworks.  
Today’s work built a strong foundation for the portfolio pieces I’ll be creating later in the week. I feel like I’m learning the language of Vendor Risk — and that’s a big step toward being job-ready.

## 🎯 What I Want to Improve Tomorrow
- Strengthen my understanding of SOC 2 report sections  
- Practice identifying exceptions and mapping them to risks  
- Start building the mindset of an auditor instead of just memorizing content  

---

## 💬 Final Thought
Today felt productive and energizing. If I can keep this pace, I’ll be moving into Vendor Risk Analyst territory very quickly.
