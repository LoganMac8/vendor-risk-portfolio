# Day 3 Reflection — Vendor Risk Analyst Blitz

Today was the first day where everything started to “click” together.  
Risk management, supply chain, SOC frameworks, and cloud security all connect directly to the vendor review process.

The biggest takeaway for me was understanding **inherent vs residual risk**, because this is what drives vendor decisions in real companies. I also realized how important outsourcing and cloud dependencies are — a vendor can look secure on paper but still rely on subservice providers that introduce hidden risks.

Understanding cloud service models and the shared responsibility matrix felt especially useful, since most vendors today are SaaS platforms and operate on AWS, Azure, or GCP.

Overall, I feel like I’m finally thinking like a Vendor Risk Analyst, not just learning definitions.  
Tomorrow’s scoring model and questionnaire work will build directly on everything from today.
