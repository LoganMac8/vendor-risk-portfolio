# Day 3 Notes — Vendor Risk Foundations

## What I Studied Today
- High-level ISO 27001 (only the relevant controls)
- Core risk concepts (inherent, residual, classification)
- Supply chain and outsourcing risk
- Frameworks relevant in vendor documentation
- Cloud risk fundamentals and shared responsibility

---

## Key Concepts I Learned
- How to score inherent vs residual risk  
- How outsourcing introduces multi-layer risk  
- Why subservice providers matter  
- The difference between SaaS/PaaS/IaaS risk  
- How SOC 2, ISO, NIST, PCI fit into vendor assessments  
- What an SLA tells you about operational risk  

---

## Notes from the TPRM Modules
- Risk is always analyzed as Likelihood × Impact  
- Residual risk determines whether we approve a vendor  
- Supply chain risk can cascade (vendor → subvendor)  
- Cloud shared responsibility is critical for SaaS vendors  
- Frameworks help validate the vendor’s control maturity
