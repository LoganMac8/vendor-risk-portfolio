# Day 5 — Reflection

Today was the first full end-to-end vendor assessment I’ve ever completed, and it gave me a lot of clarity on how the TPRM process works in practice. Doing everything myself — identifying evidence, answering the questionnaire, scoring risks, and writing the report — made the workflow finally “click.”

What surprised me most was how much of vendor risk work is really about **interpreting the controls**, not just listing them. I had to constantly ask:
- “Is this control operating effectively?”
- “What does this mean for the customer?”
- “Does this introduce meaningful risk?”
- “How does this align with real business impact?”

Even though I only used public Cloudflare documentation, the process still felt like a legitimate exercise in vendor evaluation. This reassured me that I could do this job for real vendors inside a company.

Big wins from today:
- I’m getting faster at identifying risks.
- The scoring model made decisions more objective.
- My report writing is becoming more structured.
- I’m starting to think like a risk analyst instead of a student.

What I want to improve:
- Confidence in judging control maturity
- Being more precise when describing residual risk
- Building clearer links between technical findings and business impact

Overall, today felt like a turning point. I can now visualize myself doing this work professionally, and the Cloudflare assessment is something I’d actually be proud to show a hiring manager.
