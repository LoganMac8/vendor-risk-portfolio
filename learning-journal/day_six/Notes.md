# Day 6 — Notes  
## Portfolio Project: SOC 2 Analysis

### 1. Reviewing the SOC 2 Report (High-Level, Public Info)
Today I took a deeper dive into Cloudflare’s publicly available SOC 2 material and structured the review around the four major areas:

- **Scope** — what systems and services were covered
- **System description** — how the environment operates
- **Subservice providers** — who Cloudflare relies on
- **Controls tested** — general categories of controls examined during the audit

Since SOC 2 reports are confidential, I based my notes only on what Cloudflare publicly discloses. The important part was gaining comfort with *how* a SOC 2 is organized and what an analyst looks for.

### 2. Identifying Control Exceptions (Safe Summary)
Using the safe-summary approach from Day 2, I described exception themes without referencing audit details.  
Common exception patterns for SaaS vendors include:

- Access review timing gaps  
- Configuration issues  
- Outdated documentation  
- Monitoring inconsistencies  

I paraphrased general weakness themes while staying compliant.

### 3. Writing Recommendations
I drafted realistic mitigation actions:

- Strengthening monitoring alerts  
- Improving documentation update cycles  
- Enhancing review frequency  
- Ensuring consistent configuration management  

These recommendations align with what real Vendor Risk teams expect in an assessment.

### 4. Building the SOC 2 Analysis PDF
I assembled the full SOC 2 Analysis deliverable including:

1. What the SOC 2 covers  
2. Control themes  
3. Strengths  
4. Weaknesses (safe summaries)  
5. Impact analysis  
6. Residual risk rating  
7. Final recommendation  

This structure mirrors audits and TPRM workflows used in real organizations.
