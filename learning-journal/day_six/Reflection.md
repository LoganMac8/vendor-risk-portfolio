# Day 6 — Reflection

Today’s work on the SOC 2 analysis helped me understand how much responsibility a Third-Party Risk Analyst has when reviewing audit reports. SOC 2 documents can feel overwhelming at first because they’re long, detailed, and structured in a very formal audit style. Breaking the report down into sections made the process much easier.

The biggest shift today was realizing that the goal isn’t just to *read* a SOC 2 — it’s to interpret what it means for the business. I found myself asking:

- “Does the scope match what we’re using the vendor for?”  
- “Are there control themes that could affect us?”  
- “How mature is this vendor overall?”  
- “What should leadership know before approving them?”

This exercise taught me how to think beyond controls and start thinking in terms of **business impact**, which is exactly how real TPRM teams operate.

Another takeaway: even without the private SOC report, I could still build a meaningful analysis using public documentation. That gave me confidence that I can perform these assessments no matter what level of evidence I’m provided.

By the end of the day, I felt more comfortable with audit-style writing and more confident in my ability to extract conclusions from high-level information. This was one of the most important learning days so far because SOC 2 literacy is essential in Vendor Risk.

I’m beginning to recognize patterns in controls, exceptions, and risk scoring, and I can tell my analytical thinking is improving. Overall, today felt like another major step forward.
