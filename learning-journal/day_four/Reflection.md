# Day 4 Reflection — Questionnaire + Risk Scoring

Today was one of the most practical and impactful days so far. Building the questionnaire and risk scoring model helped me understand how Vendor Risk Analysts actually evaluate third parties in the real world.

The biggest takeaway for me was how intentional the process needs to be. It’s not about checking boxes or asking long lists of questions — it’s about asking the *right* questions across the *right* categories. The goal is to quickly identify gaps and understand how a vendor protects data, handles incidents, and manages their own supply chain.

Creating the scoring model also helped me think more analytically. It forced me to put structure around risk — likelihood, impact, and the thresholds that determine whether a vendor is Low, Medium, High, or Critical risk. This was the moment where risk stopped feeling abstract and became something measurable and clear.

What really clicked today was how these two tools work together:
- The questionnaire reveals the vendor’s control maturity  
- The scoring model determines whether their risks are acceptable  

It made the entire Vendor Risk workflow feel more tangible and repeatable.

Tomorrow’s project — the full Vendor Risk Assessment — will finally bring together everything from Days 1–4. I’m feeling more confident and starting to understand the role at a deeper level.
